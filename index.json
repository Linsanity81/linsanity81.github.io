Cone joints are integral joints that generalize traditional single-direction joints such as mortise and tenon joints to support a general cone of directions for assembly. This additional motion flexibility not just reduces the risk of deadlocking for complex joint arrangements, but also simplifies the assembly process, in particular for automatic assembly by robots. On the other hand, compared to planar contacts, cone joints restrict relative part movement for improved structural stability. Cone joints can be realized in the form of curved contacts between associated parts, which have demonstrated good mechanical properties such as reduced stress concentration.To find the best trade-off between assemblability and stability, we propose an optimization approach that first determines the optimal motion cone for each part contact and subsequently derives a geometric realization of each joint to match this motion cone. We demonstrate that our approach can optimize cone joints for assemblies with a variety of geometric forms, and highlight several application examples.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"MOCCA: Modeling and Optimizing Cone-joints for Complex Assemblies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ziq Wang**","Peng Song","Mark Pauly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616889600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616889600,"objectID":"60d8ba8891c978aa491738b8e0b6ceeb","permalink":"/publication/assemblysurvey/","publishdate":"2021-03-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/assemblysurvey/","section":"publication","summary":"An assembly refers to a collection of parts joined together to achieve a specific form and/or functionality. Designing assemblies is a non-trivial task as a slight local modification on a part’s geometry or its joining method could have a global impact on the structural and/or functional performance of the whole assembly. Assemblies can be classified as structures that transmit force to carry loads and mechanisms that transfer motion and force to perform mechanical work. In this state-of-the-art report, we focus on computational design of structures with rigid parts, which generally can be formulated as a geometric modeling and optimization problem. We broadly classify existing computational design approaches, mainly from the computer graphics com- munity, according to high-level design objectives, including fabricability, structural stability, reconfigurability, and tileability. Computational analysis of various aspects of assemblies is an integral component in these design approaches. We review dif- ferent classes of computational analysis and design methods, discuss their strengths and limitations, make connections among them, and propose possible directions for future research.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"State of the Art on Computational Design of Assemblies with Rigid Parts","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616749200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616749200,"objectID":"ada0efab4c3c4090ff77ea4954bbc797","permalink":"/talk/cfseminar/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/cfseminar/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Computational Assembly for Fabrication: Shape Optimization","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yang Xu","**Ziq Wang**","Siyu Gong","Yong Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"dc5d5a29253ab2b4686bf20dd2a26634","permalink":"/publication/reusableam/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reusableam/","section":"publication","summary":"Additive manufacturing (AM) processes such as material extrusion and vat photopolymerization all require supports to print parts with overhang features. These additional supports using the same or different materials are a waste of materials since they need to be removed after the three-dimensional (3D) printing process and cannot be reused. The printing of supports is also time-consuming for the nozzle-based material extrusion processes. A new type of reusable support has been developed to address the support-related challenges in AM. The main idea is to use a set of dynamically controlled metal pins as a programmable building platform. In the layer fabrication, the metal pins will move up one-layer thickness after the printing of each layer. Also, each metal pin will automatically stop at a specified height that is determined by a combination of metal tubes, magnetic discs, and magnetic rings. Additional supports can be 3D-printed on the top surface of the metal pins, while the amount of the supports is dramatically reduced. After the printing process, the metal rods can be separated from the part and reset for the next printing job. A prototype system has been constructed to demonstrate the reusable support principle. The layout optimization and toolpath generation algorithms for the reusable support are also presented. The experimental results of several test cases show an average of nearly 40% saving on the printing time and material with increased reliability and robustness. The reusable support provides a support generation strategy that could be beneficial to other AM processes such as stereolithography and selective laser melting.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Reusable support for additive manufacturing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ziq Wang**","Peng Song","Florin Isvoranu","Mark Pauly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568160000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568160000,"objectID":"0a9a8f6f36c5ee206be772652f043b4c","permalink":"/publication/topological_interlocking/","publishdate":"2019-09-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/topological_interlocking/","section":"publication","summary":"We study assemblies of convex rigid blocks regularly arranged to approximate a given freeform surface. Our designs rely solely on the geometric arrangement of blocks to form a stable assembly, neither requiring explicit connectors or complex joints, nor relying on friction between blocks. The convexity of the blocks simplifies fabrication, as they can be easily cut from different materials such as stone, wood, or foam. However, designing stable assemblies is challenging, since adjacent pairs of blocks are restricted in their relative motion only in the direction orthogonal to a single common planar interface surface. We show that despite this weak interaction, structurally stable, and in some cases, globally interlocking assemblies can be found for a variety of freeform designs. Our optimization algorithm is based on a theoretical link between static equilibrium conditions and a geometric, global interlocking property of the assembly-that an assembly is globally interlocking if and only if the equilibrium conditions are satisfied for arbitrary external forces and torques. Inspired by this connection, we define a measure of stability that spans from single-load equilibrium to global interlocking, motivated by tilt analysis experiments used in structural engineering. We use this measure to optimize the geometry of blocks to achieve a static equilibrium for a maximal cone of directions, as opposed to considering only self-load scenarios with a single gravity direction. In the limit, this optimization can achieve globally interlocking structures. We show how different geometric patterns give rise to a variety of design options and validate our results with physical prototypes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Design and Structural Optimization of Topological Interlocking Assemblies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ziq Wang**","Peng Song","Mark Pauly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559001600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559001600,"objectID":"399c6ffa92b73cc6ec2800d03f131800","permalink":"/publication/desia/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/desia/","section":"publication","summary":"Interlocking assemblies have a long history in the design of puzzles, furniture, architecture, and other complex geometric structures. The key defining property of interlocking assemblies is that all component parts are immobilized by their geometric arrangement, preventing the assembly from falling apart. Computer graphics research has recently contributed design tools that allow creating new interlocking assemblies. However, these tools focus on specific kinds of assemblies and explore only a limited space of interlocking configurations, which restricts their applicability for design. In this paper, we propose a new general framework for designing interlocking assemblies. The core idea is to represent part relationships with a family of base Directional Blocking Graphs and leverage efficient graph analysis tools to compute an interlocking arrangement of parts. This avoids the exponential complexity of brute-force search. Our algorithm iteratively constructs the geometry of assembly components, taking advantage of all existing blocking relations for constructing successive parts. As a result, our approach supports a wider range of assembly forms compared to previous methods and provides significantly more design flexibility. We show that our framework facilitates efficient design of complex interlocking assemblies, including new solutions that cannot be achieved by state of the art approaches.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"DESIA: A General Framework for Designing Interlocking Assemblies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ziq Wang**","Jack Szu-Shen Chen","Jimin Joy","Hsi-Yung Feng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558915200,"objectID":"55bf1abd77e26adc14fb1bcc89c150ac","permalink":"/publication/machined-sharp-edge-restoration/","publishdate":"2018-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/machined-sharp-edge-restoration/","section":"publication","summary":"Grid-based machining simulation methods have become very popular due to their advantages in computational efficiency. However, these methods are prone to generating machined workpiece models with chamfer edges, which reduce model accuracy and visual quality. An effective method is presented in this paper targeting the restoration of machined edges from these chamfer edges for triangle mesh models derived from grid-based machining simulation. The method starts by detecting the chamfer edge triangles via utilizing both edge-based mesh segmentation and feature-based mesh segmentation. The outcomes of the two segmentation methods are then compared and combined to achieve improved detection accuracy. To restore the machined edges, the detected chamfer edge triangles are split by adding new points based on the neighbors of the chamfer edge triangles. Triangle quality checks are imposed during the point addition process in order to ensure that the restored edges do not negatively impact the triangle mesh quality. Once all the applicable new points are added for all the chamfer edge triangles, the edge restoration task is complete. The presented method has been implemented and executed on sample triangle mesh models derived from grid-based machining simulation. Improved edge restoration compared to that of existing edge restoration methods has been observed. Sub-second computational performance is attained for the majority of the test cases.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Machined Sharp Edge Restoration For Triangle Mesh Workpiece Models Derived From Grid-Based Machining Simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Song","Bailin Deng","**Ziq Wang**","Zhichao Dong","Wei Li","Chi-Wing Fu","Ligang Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558828800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558828800,"objectID":"a8c32cedeaff84db26ded223543eef40","permalink":"/publication/cofifab/","publishdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cofifab/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents CofiFab, a coarse-to-fine 3D fabrication solution, combining 3D printing and 2D laser cutting for cost-effective fabrication of large objects at lower cost and higher speed. Our key approach is to first build coarse internal base structures within the given 3D object using laser cutting, and then attach thin 3D-printed parts, as an external shell, onto the base to recover the fine surface details. CofiFab achieves this with three novel algorithmic components. First, we formulate an optimization model to compute fabricatable polyhedrons of maximized volume, as the geometry of the internal base. Second, we devise a new interlocking scheme to tightly connect the laser-cut parts into a strong internal base, by iteratively building a network of nonorthogonal joints and interlocking parts around polyhedral corners. Lastly, we optimize the partitioning of the external object shell into 3D-printable parts, while saving support material and avoiding overhangs. Besides cost saving, these components also consider aesthetics, stability and balancing. Hence, CofiFab can efficiently produce large objects by assembly. To evaluate CofiFab, we fabricate objects of varying shapes and sizes, and show that CofiFab can significantly outperform previous methods.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"CofiFab: Coarse-to-Fine Fabrication of Large 3D Objects","type":"publication"}]
